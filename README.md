Urban Infrastructure Data Analysis combines open NYC traffic, energy demand, and weather data to analyze cross‑system patterns and simulate resource‑use scenarios (e.g., +5 °C temperature, −10% traffic volume).

**Why this project?**
Urban datasets often live in silos. This project creates a reproducible pipeline and dashboards to study how weather shocks and traffic changes relate to energy demand, helping planners and researchers explore what‑if questions.

**Key features**
- Data ingestion & cleaning in Python (Pandas)
- Schema‑aligned datasets ready for analysis
- Scenario engine to apply counterfactuals (e.g., temp/traffic adjustments)
- Interactive dashboards (Tableau) for trends & scenarios
- Reproducible environment (requirements + make targets)
